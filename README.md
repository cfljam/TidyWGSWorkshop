# TidyWGSWorkshop

Training  material and presentations about  getting started with larger data.
The focus is on whole genome sequencing data but key enabling
 technologies and ideas are **generic**.

 - Conda for environment _and_ dependency management
 - Github repos (and gists) for project code, metadata,
      narrative and results (small data)
- Jupyter for authoring
- Modern idioms for tabular data manipulation, in memory and beyond..
    (Pandas,dplyr,data.table)
